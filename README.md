# tools

An assortment of random scripts I've written to make my coding life easier.

## generate_class.py

I use this script to generate C++ class files - headers and implementations - from file names and variables.
The generated files are in Coplien's form - default constructor, copy constructor, destructor, and overloaded
assignment operator - as well as getters and setters for each class member.
